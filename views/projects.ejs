                    <strong>Case Study: Multi-Router PC Connectivity</strong><br><br>
                    In this project, I designed and implemented a network that connected multiple routers to PCs located in different geographical areas. The goal was to establish seamless communication between the various PCs while ensuring efficient data transmission and minimizing latency.
                    <br><br>
                    The process involved configuring routers with appropriate IP addressing schemes, subnetting, and routing protocols to ensure proper communication between each device on the network. I worked with different networking devices like switches and hubs and used tools to simulate and monitor traffic between the routers and PCs. The project emphasized the importance of network scalability, reliability, and performance optimization.
                    <br><br>
                    Through this case study, I gained valuable experience in configuring routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, RIP), troubleshooting connectivity issues, and understanding the complexities of managing a multi-router network in a real-world environment.
